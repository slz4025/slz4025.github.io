        I currently work at
        <a target="_blank" href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a>,
        where I solve problems around infrastructure at scale
        and developer productivity.

        I enjoy analyzing complex systems:
        infrastructure, ecology, societies, 
        behavior, and the nature of how we experience the world.
